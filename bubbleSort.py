Bubble sort algorithm is defined as followed:

-traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
-In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
-This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.
